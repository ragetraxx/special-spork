    "gemini": "Jul 20, 2025- Try to align your mind with your emotions today, Gemini. It's possible that a powerful yet subtle force is slowly pulling you off track.

    "cancer": "Jul 20, 2025- An emotional issue could be rubbing you the wrong way, Cancer. Your impulse is to escape. Try to do so in a healthy manner. Go see a movie or read a book.

Use this time to back off and reassess the wisdom of your direction.",
    "libra": "Jul 20, 2025- The pace of things is likely to slow compared to what it was yesterday, Libra. This is probably best. Take this time to plan and stabilize.

Be patient and things will naturally come your way.",
    "scorpio": "Jul 20, 2025- There may be dreaminess about your emotions today, Scorpio, which could keep you from focusing on the task at hand.

There's a debate brewing inside you, and you're having a hard time deciding whether to be practical or more fanciful.

If nothing seems clear, wait out the storm and proceed when you have a better handle on the weather.",
    "pisces": "Jul 20, 2025- It will be a challenge to keep your emotions on an even keel today, Pisces. Conflict may be brewing and you might fear it could get out of hand. Everything will work out.
