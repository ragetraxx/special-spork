    "aries": "Feb 7, 2026- It's a great day to explore your creativity, Aries. This probably isn’t a new thing for you, since you’re artistic. Staying focused on one thing can be another story, though. Today's energy can give you the extra concentration you need to get a creative project completed. Make the most of this by either finishing something you started earlier or tackling a new project. Have fun expressing yourself and creating!",
    "taurus": "Feb 7, 2026- Taking the easy way out won't tempt you in the least today, Taurus. This isn’t to say that you usually favor this approach, by any means; yet it's safe to say that everyone is tempted from time to time. Not so for you, though, as the planetary aspects are giving you the strength to take all of the necessary steps, however long they may be. Stand your ground if a partner tries to convince you otherwise.",
    "gemini": "Feb 7, 2026- Practicality and planning will work well for you today, Gemini. It's a good time to take a long look at your financial situation. Are you where you want to be? Have you got plans in place for down the road? Do you have sufficient cash flow? Think about what you'd like to improve and make some plans. You can include talking with a financial planner or trusted banker to create more options for yourself.",
    "cancer": "Feb 7, 2026- It's a super day to make decisions, Cancer. You can sit on the fence for a little too long when it comes to serious choices. Seize the energy that flows from today's planetary aspects, make a list of things that need to be decided in the areas of work, relationships, and finances, and go down the list one by one. Don't be afraid of making a mistake. Better that than missing out entirely, don't you think?",
    "leo": "Feb 7, 2026- It's a great day to set some of your ideas into motion, Leo. The courage you need to forge ahead is available to you with this day's planetary aspects. All you need to do is use it. If your thoughts aren't clear, sit down and write your ideas out. Note the steps you need to take in order to get things rolling and then make your move. Don't let fear or insecurity hold you back!",
    "virgo": "Feb 7, 2026- A renewed sense of values and integrity may be present for you today, Virgo. Connecting with this can be extremely uplifting, as it can put everything into perspective for you. With your hardworking tendencies, it can be easy to drift from the things that are most important to you as a person. Make the most of this day by getting in touch with yourself. If you keep a journal, explore your mood on paper.",
    "libra": "Feb 7, 2026- Settling a dispute may be on your agenda today, Libra. You may find yourself getting caught smack in the middle of the stew if you aren’t careful. If this happens, the wisest thing might be to pull out. When you're in this position (especially with two people you care about), the outcome winds up hurting someone, and it may just be you. If you tell them you care about them both too much to get involved, chances are you'll be far better off.",
    "scorpio": "Feb 7, 2026- You're likely to be feeling pretty energetic today, Scorpio, making it an opportune time to do some much-needed cleaning and organizing. Why not tackle those closets, attic, and storerooms? If you have to work, your desk, workspace, and filing cabinets could use a little attention. Just think how great it will feel when everything is in order! Make the most of your energy by accomplishing as much as you can.",
    "sagittarius": "Feb 7, 2026- See about getting as active as possible today, Sagittarius. This could really give your overall health a boost, especially if you've been sedentary lately. Try something fun like engaging in sports or taking a pooch for a walk. Gardening and cutting the lawn are other activities that are better for you than sitting all day. The physical movement can reduce stress and give you a sense of accomplishment. Every part of you benefits from being active. Check it out.",
    "capricorn": "Feb 7, 2026- Good decision making will be a prominent asset today, Capricorn. It's an excellent time to make a list of things that you’ve either put off or haven't been able to settle on. This doesn't need to be things that are just related to work or finances. Consider putting effort into your personal life as well. If there are issues surrounding friends, your romantic partner, or family, this is a great opportunity to think up options.",
    "aquarius": "Feb 7, 2026- Your ability to concentrate will be enhanced today, Aquarius. If you have studying or detailed work to tend to, this will be an opportune time to get to it. Hobbies that require a lot of focus may also strike your fancy. Even if a herd of stampeding elephants runs through your space, you aren’t likely to lose your concentration. Pull out your most intensive tasks and have a great day.",
    "pisces": "Feb 7, 2026- It's time to get up and get moving, Pisces. If your job or home life leans toward the sedentary, your health can suffer if you don't engage in some physical activity. Not only is your body affected by a lack of exercise but your mind and emotional disposition can become depleted over time as well. Even a daily walk or playing a sport once a week can make a world of difference. Try something today."
