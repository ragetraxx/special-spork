    "aries": "Dec 24, 2025- You may feel somewhat grumpy and sluggish, like you have an energy deficit. But the oppressive mood of today will also lend objectivity and reality to any examination you make of what's happening in your life. For example, any matter that fails to elicit your enthusiasm is probably due for some changes.",
    "taurus": "Dec 24, 2025- The mood is somewhat oppressive today. If you could, you'd send away anyone who tries to put obstacles in your path. Or maybe you'd prefer to go away yourself! The day ahead is good for a realistic test of the waters. How far do you think you can go with your individual potential, emotionally and professionally?",
    "gemini": "Dec 24, 2025- You've decided to blow the whistle on yourself! All of a sudden it's obvious that you're not performing as well as you should be. It's time to put your self-discipline to work. You may change your work methods, budget your money more carefully, or diversify your activities. Perhaps you'll reorganize your work team. All sorts of solutions are available to you.",
    "cancer": "Dec 24, 2025- Career or family? Social recognition or personal gratification? You may feel torn between two poles and spend the better part of the day searching for answers to such questions.

    "leo": "Dec 24, 2025- You'll have to deal with some internal and external conflict. Often you're so happy to be lost in your dreams that you don't really focus on what's going on in the real world. But today alarm bells relating either to work or finances rudely awaken you. It's useless to panic. You've learned that running away only worsens the situation.",
    "virgo": "Dec 24, 2025- Your legendary impatience is playing tricks on you. You're in too much of a hurry. You may have changed things on the outside but you haven't changed who you really are.

You need to give yourself time.",
    "scorpio": "Dec 24, 2025- You may feel like you can no longer explore your inner feelings, but you must persevere. You have a tremendous capacity to bury problems deeply, and you can go through life obliviously surfing on top of them. It's true that this strategy allows you to remain in a good mood. But you may never be in such a good mood that you're profoundly happy. Wouldn't you agree?",

    "aquarius": "Dec 24, 2025- You may have some very good ideas relating to your professional field, but do you have complete mastery of them? If not, accept the fact that you can still learn from courses or experts in your field. It won't kill you to be guided a bit. Stop doubting or criticizing what others propose to you.",
    "pisces": "Dec 24, 2025- There may be some worries nagging at you. Perhaps you have a financial concern or minor health complaint. Don't let it get you down.

Until then, put your trust in other values, such as love, friendship, and faith."
