    "taurus": "Oct 22, 2025- Share your thoughts with those who can help execute them today. If you have something that needs to be moved, don't try to do it by yourself.

You shouldn't have to work especially hard to make things happen for you today.",
    "virgo": "Oct 22, 2025- Today may be one of your last chances to say what you want about a certain situation. Take advantage of the opportunity to get your words out.

    "libra": "Oct 22, 2025- You're apt to be drawn to lively and exciting things today. Dramatic and dynamic activities are the ones that you'll be most comfortable with.

    "scorpio": "Oct 22, 2025- You may have to take major action today in order to defend your position. Your current mindset has brought you to a certain point and now you're faced with having to defend that point. It may feel like the school bully is demanding your lunch money. Don't give in without a fight. The bully is just as frightened of you as you are of him.",
    "sagittarius": "Oct 22, 2025- The more action you take today, the bigger the hole you're apt to dig for yourself.
