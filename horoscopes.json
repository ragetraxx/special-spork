    "taurus": "Sep 5, 2025- It's a great day to set some goals or review existing ones, Taurus. If you don't have a working list, it's time you started one. Brainstorm without censorship.

    "cancer": "Sep 5, 2025- Take care of yourself if you feel tired, Cancer. There's no shame in slowing down or taking a day off if it's needed. If you can spend a day in bed, go for it.

    "libra": "Sep 5, 2025- Try then try again today, Libra. It can feel terrible to fail at something. Sometimes you just want to hide rather than face the possibility of humiliation.

Your goals are worthy of the effort.",

    "aquarius": "Sep 5, 2025- Do you need a change of pace, Aquarius? If things are beginning to feel boring and you're apathetic, chances are that you do.

    "pisces": "Sep 5, 2025- Mind your physical health today, Pisces. Don't push yourself if you're feeling tired and run down.

If you can't take a day off, consider what you'll do when you're forced to take a week because of illness."
