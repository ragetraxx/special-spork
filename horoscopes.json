    "aries": "Jul 25, 2025- Why me? You may feel like you ask yourself this question more than anyone else, Aries. Your life may seem like an intense roller-coaster ride that never stops. But deep down you realize that you would have it no other way. Take a break from it all today if you can. Communicate your thoughts and feelings. By talking, you will feel much better about the situation.",
    "taurus": "Jul 25, 2025- Your brain may buzz like a beehive today, Taurus. That's good. There is a great deal of information to process now. Have you been thinking about buying some new electronic equipment or small appliances for your home? Now is a great time to do some research on this project before you hand over your credit card. Use today to gather facts.",
    "gemini": "Jul 25, 2025- Don't automatically assume that you can work out all your problems alone, Gemini. Just talking things out with others may help shed light on a situation that baffled you earlier. Enlist the help of others in areas where you need it. Don't be ashamed to ask for assistance. We all have problems and issues to deal with. You aren't alone.",
    "cancer": "Jul 25, 2025- Get up early and get working, Cancer. You have a lot of emotional and physical energy that should help you accomplish whatever you need to do. The planetary energy is on your side. Take advantage of it to say what's on your mind and get a step closer to wherever you need to be. Your active, receptive nature is prominent. You should be able to find a healthy balance between giving and receiving.",
    "leo": "Jul 25, 2025- Speak up today, Leo. Perhaps no one has heard your point of view in a while. More than likely, it's incredibly important for them to hear it. Just because people don't ask for your opinion doesn't mean that it isn't valid. You have incredible insight that others don't have. Don't assume that they know what you're thinking even though you probably know what they're thinking.",
    "virgo": "Jul 25, 2025- Someone has just turned on the fan and papers are flying everywhere, Virgo. The pace is picking up and you're scrambling to pick up the pieces. Stay in close communication with others today, for this will be your saving grace. You may require others' help to gather the documents that have blown across the room. Keep an eye on things so you don't lose your place.",
    "libra": "Jul 25, 2025- No one is going to cater to your needs today, Libra, so get up and do things on your own. There's little sympathy from others, and strong opinions are a dime a dozen. There's a great deal of gossip buzzing around that you may be tempted to join. Don't enable this sort of behavior. It's only going to alienate you from others in the end.",
    "scorpio": "Jul 25, 2025- Listen closely to the wind, for the answers are blowing right in front of you, Scorpio. Make contact with people you haven't heard from in a while. You can be quite productive today in unexpected situations. Ironically, the less you plan, the more you will accomplish. Be spontaneous. Revelations will come to you in a flash.",
    "sagittarius": "Jul 25, 2025- You might be sidestepping in order to avoid a commitment today, Sagittarius. Don't keep giving someone the runaround. Be strong and let people know your thoughts even if you think their feelings will be hurt. Your job is to protect your emotions. Other people can handle their own. Be aggressive if you have to. Your sanity depends on being true to yourself.",
    "capricorn": "Jul 25, 2025- You're at a dramatic climax in your monthly emotional cycle today, Capricorn. It's quite possible that you will erupt like a volcano. Don't be ashamed about releasing these emotions. Your feminine and masculine natures are connected, and they're working harmoniously to express themselves to the fullest. Open up the gates of communication and let the stampede charge through.",
    "aquarius": "Jul 25, 2025- Your philanthropic side may want to come out and do good works today, Aquarius. Your default mode is to care for others. This is fine, but make sure it doesn't deplete your vital life force. The key is to offer advice and then walk away from the situation. You aren't responsible for other people's actions. Offer information, but leave the final decision up to the person you're trying to help.",
    "pisces": "Jul 25, 2025- Today is a terrific day, Pisces, and you can get a lot accomplished using your quick mind and sharp wit. Information is flying quickly. Grab what resonates with you and discard the rest. The more informed you are, the better equipped you will be to handle the decisions of the day. Get all the facts before you proceed."
