    "aries": "Feb 10, 2026- The establishment of a new business partnership could require a lot of paperwork today, Aries. It might be really tedious trying to make sense of all the jargon involved, but it's important to you, so you're likely to be more persistent than usual. Someone more familiar with these matters could explain the ins and outs to you. This is likely to be a very fortunate development for you, so don't lose heart. Hang in there!",
    "taurus": "Feb 10, 2026- Legal documents that concern your business may need to be executed today, Taurus. There might be a lot of paper to wade through, not to mention jargon that appears indecipherable. Don't get too impatient, however, as this is important. Instead, find someone more familiar with this sort of thing and get him or her to explain it all to you. Then, assuming it's agreeable, take care of it and move on. The results should be well worth it!",
    "gemini": "Feb 10, 2026- Today you might consider making an investment of time, energy, and perhaps a little money in a creative project of some kind, Gemini. This could also involve modern technology in some way. You could have several colleagues who want to work with you on this, and therefore the entire enterprise could be very exciting. Be sure not to lose sight of the practical details involved or you might never get it off the ground.",
    "cancer": "Feb 10, 2026- Visitors might come to your home today to discuss business of some kind, Cancer, perhaps job related, perhaps about an enterprise you're developing on your own. If you aren't careful, however, you could get caught up in conversations that are more social than practical and thus lose sight of the reasons you got together. Stay focused on the matter at hand and you could be pleasantly surprised at the results.",
    "leo": "Feb 10, 2026- A rush of excess ambition could cause you to channel a lot of your physical and mental energy into whatever work you're doing right now, Leo. This might involve writing, teaching, or speaking in some way. As a result of your zeal, your body could be exhausted but your mind spinning like a top, even though the thoughts coming up may be scattered. It might be best to pace yourself now more than you're inclined to. Stay focused!",
    "virgo": "Feb 10, 2026- An upcoming visit from someone close may have you working overtime in order to fix up your house, Virgo. Therefore, you could be tempted to go crazy buying decorative items. This is fine up to a point, but be careful! Some of the stuff that looks good in the store might not look quite the same once you get it home. Your guest is more interested in seeing you. Decorate in moderation, and have fun doing it!",
    "libra": "Feb 10, 2026- Working at home might be the answer for you today, Libra. You could be physically and mentally worn out from working too hard, but you still have important tasks to complete. You may operate better on your own territory right now, without having to fight traffic or parking problems. You tend to be very conscientious where work is concerned, sometimes to your own detriment. Don't do this today; otherwise you might burn yourself out.",
    "scorpio": "Feb 10, 2026- News you may receive about your place of business or the people you work for might bring up some doubts about your future in this organization, Scorpio. You might feel that you aren't getting anywhere. You might be considering the possibility of changing jobs or even careers. Someone may put forth a type of opportunity that you've never considered before. Think about it, but don't decide for a few days.",
    "sagittarius": "Feb 10, 2026- Paperwork involving money might seem a bit overwhelming today, Sagittarius, and you might ask a friend for advice or assistance. This person probably knows what it's all about, so listen even though you might not understand much of what he or she says! Financial benefits could be in the wind. You may be entertaining outrageous fantasies of what you're going to buy with it all. Dream all you want, but be practical when the windfall comes!",
    "capricorn": "Feb 10, 2026- Some rather tedious and boring paperwork you have to handle for your business might be a pain in the neck now, Capricorn, but it should bring a lot of benefits to you later. Therefore, you'll want to exercise your usual conscientiousness in order to assure that it gets completed. Your diligence and dedication should attract the attention of those in authority, so expect advancement in some way. Onward and upward!",
    "aquarius": "Feb 10, 2026- Books, lectures, and other sources of information regarding spiritual, metaphysical, or religious matters could have your mind spinning, Aquarius. What you read or hear is likely to be fascinating, but you might be too overwhelmed to make sense of it right now. Don't feel that you have to get it all together today. Do something else, let it all stew, and tomorrow its meaning could all appear to you in a rush.",
    "pisces": "Feb 10, 2026- A goal related to business or finance that is very important to you could require you to pay a lot of attention to paperwork today, Pisces. You're likely to spend most of the day on it since a deadline may be involved. Take care, however, that you don't get so caught up in a quest for perfection that you stress yourself out. Sometimes obsessive attention can sabotage the very aim you're working toward. Stay focused and pace yourself."
