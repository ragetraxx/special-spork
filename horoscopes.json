    "aries": "Jan 26, 2026- A partner, either your life partner or a colleague, is likely to be in an irritable mood today, which you could find a bit upsetting. Bear in mind that this person's mood probably has little if anything to do with you, Aries, or anything you've said or done. Just stay out of their way until they're over it! This isn't a good day to give or attend social events or even accept invitations. Wait until tomorrow!",
    "taurus": "Jan 26, 2026- Too many unfinished tasks or chores today might have you feeling pressured to get them done, creating unnecessary stress and strain. Pace yourself and don't panic if you have to let some of them go for today. You're probably feeling more sensitive than usual, Taurus, so you might also pick up some moods from the people around you. Take periodic breaks and go out for a walk. This should clear your head and make things easier for you.",
    "gemini": "Jan 26, 2026- Emotional levels run high among members of a group you're affiliated with as disagreements turn into quarrels. Stay out of this, Gemini, it won't do you any good. Write down your impressions and share them with the others at another time when tempers have cooled down. You might find yourself wanting to make one final push toward attaining a personal goal of your own, but you could be blocked by forces beyond your control. Try to remain patient!",
    "cancer": "Jan 26, 2026- Pressures to get unfinished tasks completed and new ones begun cause emotions to run high. Everyone, yourself included, is likely to feel nervous and stressed out, and quarrels may break out. It might be best if you keep your eyes and mind focused on the tasks at hand and not on the petty squabbles that are going on around you, Cancer. This keeps your blood pressure down and reassures those you want to impress.",
    "leo": "Jan 26, 2026- Frustrated energy resulting from inability to put your plans into action could have your nerves on edge today, Leo, and you might be tempted to get into petty quarrels with those around you. Try to find alternative outlets for your energy so as to avoid this trap. There is also the danger that you might take impulsive actions without giving it any thought. Remember to stop and think before you act; otherwise, your efforts might be wasted.",
    "virgo": "Jan 26, 2026- Overwork and the resulting stress and nerve strain might result in fevers or headaches today, Virgo. Therefore, it might be a good idea to start out the day pacing yourself and concentrating on whatever tasks are the most pressing. Don't worry if you have to leave some for later. There is a chance that others around you might get into some rather heated arguments. Stay out of it. This will only make you feel worse.",
    "libra": "Jan 26, 2026- If you're involved in a class or if you find yourself in any kind of group activity or social situation, be prepared for quarrels to break out among the people there. You could find this extremely useless and counterproductive, and you might be tempted to try to break in and put a stop to it. It's best to stay out of it, Libra. Get rid of your frustration by walking home! You'll feel better for it.",
    "scorpio": "Jan 26, 2026- Frustration and upset with others in your circle could tempt you to go out and get rid of that energy by spending a lot of money. You might overindulge in food or drink, or you could give in to impulse buying. Treat yourself a little, Scorpio, but don't go overboard. You don't want to give yourself an upset stomach, and you won't want to take unwanted items back to the store. Instead, get some exercise or throw your passions into creative pursuits.",
    "sagittarius": "Jan 26, 2026- An increased level of irritability and frustration could tempt you to take it out on friends, children, or your significant other. You're probably feeling especially energetic, with little if any outlet for that energy, Sagittarius. On days like this you might want to consider jogging, going to the gym, or taking an aerobics class. This can both provide an outlet and produce some endorphins that override the stress and strain. Go to it!",
    "capricorn": "Jan 26, 2026- A conflict between career obligations and home responsibilities could present itself today, Capricorn. You're likely to feel totally powerless in the situation, so it could cause you to feel irritable and be more snappish than usual. Try to think clearly and find a solution for your conundrum, then act on it. Avoid the temptation to quarrel with others. In the evening, go out dancing! Work off some of that frustrated energy.",
    "aquarius": "Jan 26, 2026- Long-distance phone calls from people living in distant states could bring some rather disconcerting news your way. This might arouse some anger within you, and you might be tempted to take it out on the caller. Don't do this! The person is probably only the messenger. Some short trips in your neighborhood could find you confronted with impossible traffic. If you have to go out today, Aquarius, you might get there more quickly by walking!",
    "pisces": "Jan 26, 2026- Nightmares that come your way today are likely to cause you to wake up feeling extremely angry for no tangible reason. You might want to take a close look at your dreams and try to analyze them so that you'll learn the source of your ire and how best to expunge it. Disconcerting news about money is likely to prove groundless, Pisces, so don't fly off the handle and get all stressed out when you hear it."
