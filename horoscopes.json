Don't write people off so quickly. There's something important to learn from everyone.",

    "libra": "Sep 30, 2025- Dive deep into yourself today. Bring more of your spirit into your universe. Realize that if you stay focused on one topic for just a little bit longer, you can extract another bit of knowledge. Go deeper today instead of just floating about on the surface.

    "pisces": "Sep 30, 2025- Take control of your decisions today. People might tell you what direction to take and what choice is best for you, but ultimately you're the one who knows best. Stop looking to others for guidance about your life and start finding the solutions within you. You already know the answers. You have the map you need tucked away in your pocket. Use it."
