    "aries": "Oct 11, 2025- Someone may approach you talking about investments. This person may make whatever he's pushing sound like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Remember the adage, \"If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\" If you're interested in what this person has to say, wait a few days and then check with an unbiased source. It always pays to be cautious!",
    "taurus": "Oct 11, 2025- Today you may feel like you're brimming over with physical energy. You have a lot of energy, but it isn't a good idea to go climbing mountains, running marathons, or swimming long distances right now. If you don't pace yourself, you could be exhausted by midafternoon. You may be temporarily operating on nervous energy and limited stamina.",
    "gemini": "Oct 11, 2025- Responsibilities may be weighing on your mind today. Perhaps you've promised someone help but don't have the time and energy to come through right now. Don't be afraid to tell the person. Between the two of you, you can work something out that creates a win/win situation so your friend gets the needed help and you don't tire yourself out. A little ingenuity is all it takes!",
    "cancer": "Oct 11, 2025- A tremendous burst of creative energy regarding a cherished project could hit today. Inspiration could strike, and you'll want to turn as much of that into physical reality as possible. Don't be disappointed if your insights are exhausted quickly and you hit a roadblock. Don't try to force it. Stop working for now and take it up later. The inspiration will come again!",
    "leo": "Oct 11, 2025- Today you could be in the public eye in some way. Perhaps you're teaching a class, giving a lecture, or leading a discussion group. Whatever it is, don't be surprised if you alternate between inspired and free-flowing articulation and total mental block. When the latter happens, ask for questions. That'll give them a chance to speak and get your brain going again.",
    "virgo": "Oct 11, 2025- Too many errands to run? Too many calls to make? Don't be surprised if you feel like you're running in circles. You might be trying to juggle career concerns while making plans for a journey of some kind. Take time to relax. Go to a movie and forget everything for a while. It isn't worth making yourself crazy.",
    "libra": "Oct 11, 2025- Unexpected expenses, perhaps for house repairs, might require some budgetary juggling. You might have to rob Peter to pay Paul. This will probably offend your practicality, but it's only temporary. With your sound financial sense, you'll be able to balance your budget again soon. Your diet over the next few days may include a lot of peanut butter sandwiches.",
    "scorpio": "Oct 11, 2025- Surliness on the part of a partner could catapult you into a gloomy mood. Your friend isn't communicating very well, and you probably wonder if it's something you said or did. Chances are it's not. All signs indicate that it's business. Don't try to force your partner to share these concerns with you, as this will only cause further retreat. Your friend will talk when the time's right.",
    "sagittarius": "Oct 11, 2025- Too much partying could have you feeling a little under the weather. The food and drink may have been great, but today you'd better eat plain but nourishing food. You may not be inclined to exercise, but a brisk walk or yoga class might be just what you need. It will also clear your head. You should be yourself again by midafternoon.",
    "capricorn": "Oct 11, 2025- Friends and lovers alike may take unfair advantage of your good nature. Some may want you to do them favors. Others might want to use you as a sounding board for their problems. You won't want to turn them away. If you can't avoid them, you should learn to say, \"I'll help you later!\" You can only be in one place at a time, and there are only 24 hours in a day.",
    "aquarius": "Oct 11, 2025- Family members might have too much on their minds today and ask you for more help than you're prepared to give. Make sure you stay calm and focused so you can decide which difficulties are most urgent and need to be handled first. Don't be afraid to tell others your decision. When possible, give advice rather than help. Sometimes that's all people really need.",
    "pisces": "Oct 11, 2025- Today you might spend time helping a sibling or neighbor prepare for a trip. Or more than one person could ask you for advice on business matters, legal papers, investments, homework, or other intellectual concerns. Try not to spread yourself too thin or you won't be much use to anybody, least of all you. If it doesn't all get done today, there's always tomorrow."
