    "taurus": "Mar 24, 2025- Travel plans might have you confused, Taurus. You may have a number of possibilities in mind, and all seem equally attractive.

Confusion is likely to reign. Wait a few days and then consider your options carefully.",
    "gemini": "Mar 24, 2025- New earning or investment possibilities could have you in a quandary over which one is the best for you, Gemini. There are a number of solutions - technology may be one of them - but this isn't the time to make any important decisions. Everything may seem equally attractive to you!

Be like Scarlet O'Hara and think about it tomorrow! You will be more focused and less doubtful by then.",
    "leo": "Mar 24, 2025- Others' attitudes toward you may seem to be changing. You may not be sure what this means. The fact is, Leo, you're changing, and some of your friends may like what you're becoming and others may feel less comfortable. You can't stop what's happening.

    "scorpio": "Mar 24, 2025- An intellectual problem may prove confusing, Scorpio, and reading and research reveal contradictory information. You might also hear some gossip that doesn't seem quite right. This isn't the day to believe everything you read or hear or to try to make sense of anything that has you befuddled.
