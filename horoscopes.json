    "taurus": "Sep 3, 2025- Feed your mind today, Taurus. While you enjoy being active and social, you do get bored quickly. You'll need to give yourself a constant supply of intriguing, fresh material in order to feel your best. Explore an interesting subject or learn a new hobby.

    "leo": "Sep 3, 2025- Leo, try not to be fooled by others. If you don't know a person well and you aren't sure about him or her, trust your instincts.

This can save you problems down the road.",

Just use caution and keep yourself safe.",
    "libra": "Sep 3, 2025- The energy you feel today may have you so jittery that others don't know what to do. The day's aspects can really bring a boost and you'd be wise to plan to do things so you have an avenue to spend it all. Get busy with physical chores. Pull things out, organize, move furniture around - whatever it takes. It's better to be productive than drive everyone crazy.",
    "scorpio": "Sep 3, 2025- Venturing into something completely new and different may be what you need, Scorpio.

Whether you delve into cooking, astrophysics, or genealogy, you'll find something new.",
    "capricorn": "Sep 3, 2025- If you meet new people today, Capricorn, be careful. Some can appear interesting because they're bold or dangerous. Perhaps they do things you'd never dream of doing.

If danger excites you too much, it may be time to make some changes in your life.",
    "aquarius": "Sep 3, 2025- You might have to make a choice between telling the truth and a lie. Sometimes this can be a difficult choice, especially if you're afraid you'll hurt someone's feelings. However, a lie can take far more energy than the truth. Consider what you'd want the other person to do in your place. Stick to your ethics, even of it's tough.",
    "pisces": "Sep 3, 2025- Kindheartedness is wonderful, but being taken advantage of can be a danger. You really need to trust your instincts to keep this from happening. If what you hear doesn't match what you feel, trust your feeling. In the event that you get used, move past it. It would be a shame if resentment permanently dampened your giving nature."
