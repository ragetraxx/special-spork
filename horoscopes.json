This is the time to stand up and make use of your talent and skills.",
    "gemini": "Jun 9, 2025- There may be a bit of tension and conflict in your world today, Gemini. Be prepared for mild contention that could turn into an all-out war if you aren't careful.

Quality is more important than speed, and a peaceful mind is more efficient and productive than a stressed one.",
    "virgo": "Jun 9, 2025- To fight or not to fight may be the question of the day, Virgo. Your sensitive, feminine side is likely to say one thing while your masculine, combative side says another. The key is to not act hastily in any situation. Make sure you proceed from a neutral platform instead of reacting from a point of aggression caused by someone else.",
    "libra": "Jun 9, 2025- Be careful that you don't put your foot in your mouth today, Libra. You may have a tendency to jump the gun, so be conscious of how you use your energy.

    "sagittarius": "Jun 9, 2025- You may feel a bit anxious today, Sagittarius, and it may be hard to settle down.

It might be best to put up some sort of psychic shield to protect yourself from other people's moods.",
    "capricorn": "Jun 9, 2025- Your heart should feel quite generous today, Capricorn. You're most likely feeling the need to keep everyone smiling.

Grab hold of the reins if you need to.",
    "pisces": "Jun 9, 2025- You may find that there is some opposition from other people today, Pisces, especially concerning emotions. You may feel threatened in some way. An aggressive attitude could be making you feel inferior or unworthy of certain attention. Wanting peace, justice, and harmony doesn't make you wimpy or inferior, as some people may suggest. These qualities are your strengths, not your weaknesses."
