    "cancer": "Nov 13, 2025- Sit back and receive instead of trying to make things happen by imposing your will. You're always taking action and directing your energy outward.

    "scorpio": "Nov 13, 2025- Turn one part of the project over to someone you feel is more qualified to handle it. There's no sense trying to do everything yourself when you know someone out there is better suited to the task. Today calls for a steady and patient hand.

    "sagittarius": "Nov 13, 2025- You may feel emotionally good but the more you express yourself the more critical others become of your sensitivity.

    "aquarius": "Nov 13, 2025- Things should come together nicely as long as you've done the necessary prep work to make it successful. The burners are hot and it's time to add the ingredients.

    "pisces": "Nov 13, 2025- Your witty, social attitude may not be appreciated, given the emotional and sober mood of the day. You adjust your outfit to reflect current weather patterns. If you dress in silk, you won't be too happy when it rains and you have no umbrella. Consider such things when you walk into a room full of people today. What is the mood? How can you fit in with it and lift it?"
