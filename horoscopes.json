    "aries": "Mar 23, 2025- You're becoming much more perceptive, Aries. At the same time, your psyche and unconscious knowing are also more acute. You may find that you know more about the way someone feels than that person does. More than likely, this sort of perspective is causing you to want to take aggressive action in order to shake people up and help them open their own eyes to the situation at hand.",
    "taurus": "Mar 23, 2025- You're likely to act with great immediacy, Taurus. You will instantly know what to do in a situation, especially a crisis.

Go out on a limb and take a chance that you might not have considered before.",
    "gemini": "Mar 23, 2025- If someone tries to criticize you, Gemini, don't be afraid to defend yourself. Other people aren't going to be afraid to speak their minds, and you shouldn't either. You may feel like someone is prodding you with a stick. They probably just want to get some sort of reaction out of you. Be honest about how you feel and explain your statements instead of just being curt.",

    "sagittarius": "Mar 23, 2025- There's an explosive quality about the day. You may walk along, minding your own business, when someone accidentally bumps into you. Your first reaction may be to push that person back. Carelessness on the part of others may cause you to get worked up into fits of rage. Do your best to keep these tendencies under control, especially when driving.",
    "capricorn": "Mar 23, 2025- You have a tremendous amount of drive and enthusiasm to help you move forward in your projects, Capricorn. Be careful that you don't act hastily or impulsively.

Be safe.",
    "aquarius": "Mar 23, 2025- A relationship with a close partner may get a bit confused, Aquarius. You could react quickly to a situation without really thinking before speaking.

    "pisces": "Mar 23, 2025- You may run into a great deal of opposition from just about every quarter, Pisces. The most frustrating part about this is that even the people you turn to for help will transform the situation into an even bigger mess. Instead of finding relief, you may find more complications and misunderstandings. Perhaps you need to take the situation into your own hands and deal with it yourself."
