    "leo": "Apr 11, 2025- You may have heard a juicy story about a friend lately and be just dying to share it with your entourage, Leo. Be careful with this impulse!

    "sagittarius": "Apr 11, 2025- This is a good day to spend with your family, Sagittarius, as you love to do.

    "capricorn": "Apr 11, 2025- Today's planetary energies may put spiritual matters in your mind, Capricorn. You may not be thinking in religious terms.

If you're short on time, a monetary gift can help you feel more connected and peaceful.",
    "aquarius": "Apr 11, 2025- You may be thinking about political or social matters today, Aquarius, specifically, the deterioration of the planet. You may be worried about your future and that of your children. You might try to bring up the subject at a social gathering. Someone you meet there is bound to teach you something about the issue. If you need to get further involved raising people's awareness of this issue, do it!",
    "pisces": "Apr 11, 2025- Today is going to present not only a continuation but also an intensification of the strong energies that have been pushing you toward self-discovery. If you've put up some resistance, you're going to be uncomfortable. Try to participate in the task. Question yourself. Why do you say and do certain things? If you're honest, the rewards will outweigh the growing pains."
