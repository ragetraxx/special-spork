    "cancer": "Oct 28, 2025- It's important to remain flexible, but not so much that you can't make a decision about anything. Your head says one thing while your heart says another.

    "sagittarius": "Oct 28, 2025- You may feel like a snail emerging from its shell. When no one is looking, you slowly and cautiously stick your head out and put up your antennae to take a reading on the outside world.

Be careful about letting your defenses down too much, because a big, hungry bird may be looking for dinner.",
    "capricorn": "Oct 28, 2025- Your boisterous, generous attitude is inspiring and welcomed by others. There are also some people who consider your behavior ostentatious or arrogant.

Sit down and talk with people one-on-one to understand how they feel.",
    "aquarius": "Oct 28, 2025- Just as soon as you taste success, something comes along to make you feel badly about it.

Trust yourself when you find them."
