You will feel extra sensitive and loving, and people will be drawn to you because of it. You're able to look at your feelings in a rational, levelheaded manner instead being at the mercy of your wildly fluctuating emotions.",
    "taurus": "Mar 26, 2025- There may be some rough spots today that could be difficult to iron out, Taurus. No matter what you do, you land just a bit short of the mark. Perhaps your indecisiveness is making it too difficult for you to be effective. Your easygoing way of naturally going with the flow is making it easier for other people to manipulate you into doing what they want. Take control of the situation.",
    "gemini": "Mar 26, 2025- Nurture your artistic, romantic side today, Gemini. Your feet may be a little cold, but that's what you get for splashing around in the rain. Don't worry about it. Your heart and mind are finally on the same page and it's much easier to say exactly how you feel. Take off the wet socks and put on a dry pair. Take to the streets and meet up with a fun troupe of merriment tonight.",
    "cancer": "Mar 26, 2025- Today may be one of those days when you feel all dressed up with nowhere to go. Don't worry about the details, Cancer. Follow your heart to a fantasyland and join the outlandish and bizarre. The answer you seek is around the corner. You may sense that it's close but yet far. This is completely understandable. Take control of your destiny and work toward the goals that you've set.",

These beginning points are highlighted. You should think about how you want to be remembered in the future. Your heart and mind are working harmoniously, so take advantage of this to lay down some plans.",
    "virgo": "Mar 26, 2025- This is one of those days in which you can't figure out what to order for dinner. You're the official owner of the cloudy head today, Virgo. You're waiting at the deli counter trying to figure out what you want and when it's your turn to order, you've already forgotten. Your emotions may be so tied up in your brain that you can't think straight. Try to mellow out and watch a movie.",
    "libra": "Mar 26, 2025- Go to an art museum, Libra. Your mind and heart are working in conjunction with each other, and you're apt to be especially receptive to elements of our world that fuse these two together. Make an evening out of the event, and be sure to take a good friend or romantic partner. Have a good meal, and don't forget dessert. Appreciate the world for all its natural wonder.",
    "scorpio": "Mar 26, 2025- It might seem like your brain and heart are working against you today, Scorpio. You might sense that they've teamed up to keep your head in a swirling maelstrom of confusion that you can't seem to pull out of. Look beyond the mundane confusion of this day. Connect with your sensitive, receptive side, sit back, and let someone else do the thinking.",
    "sagittarius": "Mar 26, 2025- Your moods are always fluctuating. Today looks like you're on an up note, Sagittarius, so enjoy the caring, sensitive mood of the day.

Realize that we are all one.",
    "capricorn": "Mar 26, 2025- You might find it difficult to connect with others today, Capricorn. Your brain may seem like it's in some other dimension. Appreciate the power of circular movement in your life. Seek things that are fast paced and a bit bizarre. Go to a roller derby. A simple thing like a coin rolling down the sidewalk may allow you to connect with another way of thinking about your life.",
    "aquarius": "Mar 26, 2025- Things may be coming to a dramatic climax for you, Aquarius. It may seem like everything is working against you. Take note that this is an excellent time to find balance and gain a much greater perspective on the issues in your life. If you're trying to figure out where your heart and brain are hiding, you should look on the opposite side of the world. They're over there discussing things together.",
    "pisces": "Mar 26, 2025- Dig out the paints and get your creative energy flowing, Pisces. Keep in mind that you might not have the discipline or commitment to finish any project you start today, but you most certainly won't lack creative energy. Merge your mental and emotional processes and have them work together on a blank canvas. Bring beauty to the world by letting yourself shine for others to see."
