    "gemini": "Apr 19, 2025- You may get frustrated when people who've taken shortcuts gain on your position, Gemini. You believe that hard work is necessary to get where you need to go. You aren't afraid to expend the blood and sweat needed for success. You've planned well and you're on track. Try not to get upset by others who take the easy route.

    "cancer": "Apr 19, 2025- You may not realize the effect of your erratic behavior on other people, Cancer.

    "virgo": "Apr 19, 2025- Although your general mood is good, Virgo, this doesn't mean your day will go off without a hitch. When it comes to projects and getting things done, you may be the one to take the lead. You're good at motivating the troops to move as a unified force.

    "scorpio": "Apr 19, 2025- Be quick to point out when you see an injustice, Scorpio. If someone says something offensive or untrue, don't let it slide.

Your honest nature and good moral sense are important qualities and should be recognized accordingly.",
    "sagittarius": "Apr 19, 2025- Your emotions may be erratic, Sagittarius. You may want everyone to know what you're feeling and act out in an immature manner to get noticed. In a way, you feel like a kid who will do anything to get a parent's attention, even if the action is naughty. At the same time, you don't want to be seen as the bad kid. As a result, you may just mope until someone asks you what's wrong.",
    "capricorn": "Apr 19, 2025- You may be fidgeting, Capricorn, given your general restlessness. You're anxious to get up and do some sort of song and dance, and yet you insist on waiting for the right time. Meanwhile, you're getting extremely anxious for your big moment.
