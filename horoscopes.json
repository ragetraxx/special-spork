    "aries": "Apr 7, 2025- You may feel tension in your world today without really knowing why, Aries. This feeling of conflict may have your stomach in knots, making it difficult to deal with anything or anyone in a rational manner. Try not to take everything personally when people disapprove of your actions. Their reaction is to your behavior, not necessarily to you as a person.",
    "taurus": "Apr 7, 2025- Don't downplay your abilities now, Taurus. You're on the brink of greatness, so act like it. Things should go quite well if you let them. Don't clog up the works by thinking that you're unworthy of the good luck that is sure to come your way. If things don't work out exactly the way you want them to, take it as a sign that the situation wasn't right for you anyway.",
    "gemini": "Apr 7, 2025- Take a leap of faith today, Gemini. Consider taking two or three. Trust that things will follow through perfectly. You will be drawn to those who put a smile on your face. These are the people you need to stick close to now. A positive attitude will lead you in a positive direction. Have fun with your life instead of getting depressed by it.",
    "cancer": "Apr 7, 2025- When others can't seem to decide which way to proceed, it will become crucial that you stand up and be the deciding force, Cancer. Be as aggressive as you need to be today in order to set things in motion. The elements are already in place. What's needed now is a bit of follow-through. You're in the perfect position to provide this missing piece of the puzzle.",
    "leo": "Apr 7, 2025- Your head may be going in a thousand different directions today, Leo. You may not have much time to stop and think about your next move. Things will come up suddenly and you will need to be able to react quickly. The faster you move, the less time you will have to react. For this reason, you may want to consider a side route where things are flowing a bit more slowly.",
    "virgo": "Apr 7, 2025- You're apt to feel emotionally brave today, Virgo, so take advantage of this feeling by extending it to the people around you. Try not to get anxious or jump ahead of yourself. Enjoy where you are at this very moment. Don't get stressed about things you feel you need to do. Be happy with yourself regardless of what you end up accomplishing.",
    "libra": "Apr 7, 2025- Your biggest dream is in front of you, Libra, yet there's a large object standing in your path. When you peer around one way, the goal is only partly visible. When you peer around the other way, the other side of the dream becomes clear, but you still don't have the complete picture. Instead of working with obscured vision, get rid of the thing that's lying directly in your path.",
    "scorpio": "Apr 7, 2025- Luck and prosperity lie within your grasp now, Scorpio. The only problem is that you might not notice because you're so caught up in some emotional drama that occupies your entire being. Don't concern yourself with issues that don't directly pertain to you. Your time and energy are too precious. Keep your mind focused on your biggest goals.",
    "sagittarius": "Apr 7, 2025- You may fall into a bottomless pit today, Sagittarius. Be careful about offering so much of yourself that you drain your internal resources. You might think other people will be equally generous about offering themselves to you. Don't assume this. You're better off assuming that you will get nothing in return. Play your cards from this standpoint and you may be a bit more conservative.",
    "capricorn": "Apr 7, 2025- Don't just talk about grand trips around the world - start planning them, Capricorn. If you don't start saving your resources and reserving blocks of time for your dreams, they may never come true. Today is a good time to set things in motion. Your attitude is likely to be more flexible, and you will find that this way of thinking will bring you to the people and places that can help you the most.",
    "aquarius": "Apr 7, 2025- Think of yourself as a great pioneer crossing the frontier for the first time, Aquarius. Acknowledge yourself as the important person that you are. Believe in yourself and your rights and opinions. Indecision could hinder your actions. Don't let it. Take an active stance at all times. Be brave in the face of hardships that you might confront today. You will be greatly rewarded when you do.",
    "pisces": "Apr 7, 2025- Make sure you keep up your end of the bargain today, Pisces. People are counting on you whether you realize it or not. You may get the idea that you can sneak out of responsibility if you lay low and not say a word. The fact of the matter is that people are watching you and they will know when you haven't upheld your promises to the group."
