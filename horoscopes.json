    "aries": "May 4, 2025- A family member may withdraw from you, Aries. This person appears to be going through a private emotional crisis and isn't apt to confide in you now. Your inclination could be to push it, but this could be a mistake. Give him or her the chance to share with you when the time is right. Sometimes we need to work things out for ourselves. Be patient.",
    "taurus": "May 4, 2025- You could get some strange phone calls today, Taurus. There could be a few hang-ups, wrong numbers, or friends who forget why they called! Communication isn't likely to run smoothly, so you may have to make an effort to choose the right words, go into as much detail as possible, and ask if you're being understood. Otherwise, things could get more complicated.",
    "gemini": "May 4, 2025- Money matters may seem up in the air today, Gemini. Your usual practicality may desert you. This could make you stressed and angry because you're perfectly capable of dealing with your finances. Don't worry. The vagueness should pass by tomorrow. In the meantime, get some help, or if your concerns aren't too urgent, wait a day or two. Give yourself a break.",
    "cancer": "May 4, 2025- You might be in the midst of an exciting creative project with a partner, Cancer, and anxious to move forward so that you can present it to the public. But you might feel distracted and unable to focus on your work. Don't get too upset. These things happen. Be patient and wait until tomorrow if you have to. You will be back in the groove by then.",
    "leo": "May 4, 2025- If you've been planning to spend a day meditating, Leo, this is the day to do it. You're in an elevated frame of mind, not in a space to focus on mundane matters. Artistic inspiration could come to you now. Any kind of exercise should get the endorphins flowing. But don't expect to get any practical work done. You're definitely out of this world.",
    "virgo": "May 4, 2025- Communication with friends and lovers may be limited by emotional factors today, Virgo. You may have a tendency to overreact to casual comments that are probably innocent but that you misinterpret as offensive. Quarrels over nothing could result, which could raise your blood pressure and stress level for no good reason. If ever there was a day to think before speaking, this is it.",
    "libra": "May 4, 2025- A phone call could inform you of difficulties at home that require that you deal with them right away, Libra. This is nothing to be alarmed about, just one of those irritating little hassles that requires attention when you'd rather turn in another direction. It could be as innocuous as a broken appliance. Take care of it efficiently so you can get back to your activities. Stay calm!",
    "scorpio": "May 4, 2025- A rather spacey friend or acquaintance from far away could call today, Scorpio, perhaps to propose a visit. This might not be convenient now, and could put you in a quandary as to whether or not to agree to it. Your decision eventually comes down to how much you care for this person and how badly you want to see him or her. Think carefully before saying yes or no.",
    "sagittarius": "May 4, 2025- Financial paperwork might have you baffled today, Sagittarius. You might not be in the right frame of mind to do it now, so if it isn't urgent, wait a day or two. If you need to take care of it immediately, don't be too shy about consulting someone else. You will be glad you did, and you won't have to wonder whether or not you did it right.",
    "capricorn": "May 4, 2025- You and a current or potential romantic partner may be in a strange space today, Capricorn. Intellectual awareness battles emotional doubts. Communication could be vague and easily misinterpreted, so choose your words carefully, even though it may be difficult to find the right ones. Your relationship should survive the day, but your understanding of each other could suffer if you aren't careful.",
    "aquarius": "May 4, 2025- Your intuition is operating at a high level, Aquarius, but you may not be able to make sense of the psychic impressions you're receiving. The emotions, images, and symbols you pick up from others and the astral plane could be vague and easily misinterpreted. They could be important, though. Write them down and look at them in a day or so. You should be able to make sense of them then.",
    "pisces": "May 4, 2025- Creative energy may be high today, Pisces, but you may be unable to use it the way you'd like. Perhaps you don't have a project to work on or you have writer's block. Ideas may come, but you don't know what to do with them. The best course may be to write them down. The very process of writing could open doors for you. At least you will have your thoughts for another day."
