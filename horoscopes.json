Perhaps the plumbing or electricity needs attention. If a family member is upset, Aries, keep the lines of communication open. If there are problems that need attention, get them out of the way now.",
    "taurus": "May 31, 2025- Don't be surprised if many visitors come to your door today. A relative or co-worker could be in a black mood, which could spill over to you, as you're feeling more intuitive than usual. Realize that this isn't coming from you, Taurus, and let it go! Misinformation could come your way by phone, email, or mail. Check out the facts before you buy into it.",

All is better than it seems. Realize that today you're likely to blow every little setback out of proportion. Give everything you try your very best effort. Go out tonight and have a good time!",
    "cancer": "May 31, 2025- Communication with friends or family may not come easily today, Cancer. An unusual level of inhibition could keep you from reaching out to others. You might try to shake this off by working too hard, even if you aren't sure exactly what you want to do. This is a good day to read, study, or work on projects in solitude. A long walk during the day could clear your head and reignite your enthusiasm.",
    "leo": "May 31, 2025- Your intuition is likely to be operating at a very high level today, Leo. This isn't a good day to be around sick or depressed people. You will probably pick up their gloom and it could possibly spoil your day. This is a good day to finish old projects that you may have postponed. Your insights and ingenuity are likelier than usual to give you the motivation you need.",
    "virgo": "May 31, 2025- Fear about your financial security could plague you today, Virgo. Dissatisfaction with some of work you've been doing and delays in reaching some of your goals might have you wondering what you could do better. Doubts about a friend's motives might cause you to waver in your trust of that person. Take the time to consider everything objectively. All is probably not as it seems.",
    "libra": "May 31, 2025- Have you been wondering if you're in the right profession? Disillusionment with your field could have you feeling mildly ill from stress and considering a total career change. Perhaps this is the right course of action to take, but perhaps not. Look into the options available and see how you feel about them, Libra, but wait a few days before making any final decisions.",
    "scorpio": "May 31, 2025- Unsettling news from far away could have you somewhat upset and a little depressed. The temptation to withdraw and brood might seem too strong to resist, but this may not be the best course of action. Getting things done is likely to be the best therapy in emotional situations like this, Scorpio. So if there's a new project you've been considering, this is the day to start it.",
    "sagittarius": "May 31, 2025- A friend might be ill, causing you considerable worry. One of the goals you've been trying to reach could be delayed in some way, causing frustration. Your financial situation could also be on your mind. You could be worrying needlessly, Sagittarius. The situation is cloudy and may not be as unsettling as it seems. You may have received some misinformation. Check the facts before making yourself crazy.",
    "capricorn": "May 31, 2025- Relations with colleagues could be a bit strained due to increased job stress. If you've been thinking of entering a business or romantic partnership, this isn't the day to decide. Your mind may be a bit muddled. Misunderstandings or misinformation could cause you to doubt the wisdom of the partnership. This needs to be considered objectively, Capricorn. Your doubts may be groundless.",
    "aquarius": "May 31, 2025- Today you might feel a little under the weather due to physical and emotional stress over the past few days. Take it easy today if you can.

Nothing will come up that can't be handled.",
    "pisces": "May 31, 2025- Disturbing dreams or unsettling moods could arise today, causing you to wonder if something is wrong or something bad is going to happen. Let it go, Pisces.

You could also be picking up on others' moods, as your intuition is high."
