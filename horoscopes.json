    "gemini": "Jan 30, 2026- You may feel like going back to being a student in junior high, Gemini, just going through puberty and joining the other kids in animated discussions about who likes whom and who’s going out with whom.

    "scorpio": "Jan 30, 2026- Today is one of those days when you could feel lethargic and downbeat, Scorpio. For some reason, even if you have a driving urge to get up and do something, it seems as if there’s a two-ton weight sitting right on top of your head. Meanwhile, everyone else is off and running.
