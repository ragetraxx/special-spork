    "aries": "Oct 13, 2025- Was there a task you wanted to have completed by now that was delayed for reasons beyond your control? Don't obsess over it. It isn't your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it. Find something else to do so that thoughts of this chore don't creep in. Better yet, go out with a friend. If the Universe had meant for that task to be completed, it would have been!",
    "taurus": "Oct 13, 2025- Over the past few years you've been aware that both you and your chosen life path are changing. This hasn't always been easy for you, because it sometimes means saying goodbye to parts of yourself that you're rather fond of. Today the tension of the past week may get to you. Defuse the tension. Go for a workout, shop, or clean the house. Keep the emotions in check.",
    "gemini": "Oct 13, 2025- Are you planning to hear a sermon, lecture, or speech of some kind today? Don't be surprised if what the speaker says turns out to be more hot air than useful information. He or she is probably more interested in venting feelings than presenting the facts. Opinions can be valuable, too, so listen. Take it all with a grain of salt until you've checked out the facts.",
    "cancer": "Oct 13, 2025- Dark dreams may haunt your sleep and cause you to awaken in the night. The dreams probably represent nothing more than your unconscious mind releasing the darkest of your worries, fears, and frustrations that you've been going through over the past week. A closer study of what the symbols mean to you could be enlightening. Write them down!",
    "leo": "Oct 13, 2025- Your partner may be worried because a family member is ill. This could cause your friend to be distracted. If this is a love partner, offer sympathy, but don't expect any gratitude now. If this is a business partner, you may have to take on a heavier workload over the next week. The family member will recover, but your partner won't be much good to anyone until then.",
    "virgo": "Oct 13, 2025- Have you resolved to give your house a thorough cleaning? You may have gone to the store and bought every conceivable type of cleaner. You're determined not to quit until the house is spotless. Use natural cleaners if possible. Chemical substances could seem especially harsh today. Second, don't try to do it all now. Take care of the worst and then leave the rest for tomorrow.",
    "libra": "Oct 13, 2025- If you're in the mood for love, remember to be sensitive to your partner's needs and give lots of love in return. Don't forget that the old standbys of champagne and chocolate still work! Or a warm bubble bath - that's sure to relieve any tension.",
    "scorpio": "Oct 13, 2025- A woman, perhaps your mother, could visit you today. She may not be in a great mood, so perhaps you'd better take her out in public where she'll have to maintain some self-control. If not, you could set yourself up for a scolding over something that seems inconsequential. Defuse the situation by encouraging her to talk about what's really bothering her. It's probably not you.",
    "sagittarius": "Oct 13, 2025- Traffic in your neighborhood could be congested beyond anything you've seen before. Perhaps an accident or road construction is blocking the street. It may be nearly impossible to get anywhere by car, even the grocery store. If you must go out, either walk or ride a bike or it might take an hour to do what would normally take a few minutes. Better yet - stay home!",
    "capricorn": "Oct 13, 2025- You're romantic by nature, but today you're probably more interested in sensuality than roses and champagne. Even the idea of inviting seduction seems too insipid right now. You're more inclined to action. This is OK your lover is in the same frame of mind. Use your intuition to judge. If not, you might have to go for the champagne and roses after all.",
    "aquarius": "Oct 13, 2025- You're apt to feel rather tense today and blame it on boredom and discontent with your current life. You could spend much of the morning daydreaming, formulating outrageous plans to escape what you see as a rut. While doing this you might discover an idea that's not only appealing but also workable. Consider it carefully over the next few days. You might want to go for it!",
    "pisces": "Oct 13, 2025- Do you feel like you're about to explode? Tension may have built up through the week and now there may be no outlet for it. If you aren't careful, you might take it out on those closest to you. Go for a workout or clean the house. Engage in any kind of physical activity and get the endorphins going so you can feel good again. Life's too short to waste on being stressed and upset."
