    "aries": "Jun 4, 2025- You might have visitors, Aries, or even a hot date scheduled for tonight. By midafternoon you might feel too tired to go out and wonder if you should cancel. It's best to keep your activities low-key. Have coffee and cake at home instead of going out, and get the cake from a bakery! Your evening should be full of exciting, stimulating conversation. You'll be glad you stuck with your plans.",
    "taurus": "Jun 4, 2025- Deliveries that you expect could be delayed, Taurus. Today you might learn something shocking about a neighbor or relative. The gossip might spread rapidly through your community. This could have you reeling even though it might be exaggerated. You might visit a few people nearby or spend a lot of time on the phone trying to learn the truth. Don't take anything you hear at face value.",
    "gemini": "Jun 4, 2025- Some good but surprising news could come your way today, Gemini. Perhaps a family member or friend will call or drop by with a surprising development that directly affects you. In the evening, go out together and celebrate. Don't forget to include your special someone in your celebration plans.",
    "cancer": "Jun 4, 2025- Today may start out frustrating, Cancer. Be prepared! Some equipment might go on the blink and it could take a while to get it fixed. A temporary separation from your partner could also be disappointing. You may have a lot of physical energy for which you have little immediate outlet. Take a long walk. This would not only provide an energy outlet but also clear your head.",
    "leo": "Jun 4, 2025- Your level of artistic inspiration is high today, Leo. Dreams or meditation may bring up some spiritual insights and revelations, and you may promptly forget them upon coming out of your dream or meditative state. This could prove frustrating! Try writing them down even if you only remember snatches. This can help bring them to the surface again. You will want a record of them anyway.",
    "virgo": "Jun 4, 2025- Some upsetting news regarding money could throw you into a dither today, Virgo. Perhaps a check you've been expecting hasn't arrived on time. Maybe the bank has made an error regarding your account. It isn't anything that can't be straightened out, though it's going to be a pain making all the calls. Basically, all should be going very well for you. This is only a temporary setback.",
    "libra": "Jun 4, 2025- A setback in your career might have you feeling disoriented, Libra. Equipment might be involved. Don't go crazy. It's only temporary. Your determination, efficiency, and practicality should take care of it in no time. Basically, you're probably feeling optimistic about the future and unlikely to change that energy any time soon. Try not to worry about problems today. Spend time relaxing and enjoying the company of friends and family.",
    "scorpio": "Jun 4, 2025- A delivery that you were expecting from far away might be delayed, Scorpio, causing you to wonder if it might have been lost. It hasn't. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do but wait. Mechanical equipment could also go out of whack, necessitating a call to a repair service. This could set you back some and make you antsy. Try to find something else to do!",
    "sagittarius": "Jun 4, 2025- Today you may feel especially passionate, Sagittarius, and desire a romantic encounter. You might even have a hot date scheduled. Don't be surprised if it has to be postponed for reasons beyond anyone's control. You might try to sublimate those feelings through creative activities. Romantic novels and movies could also prove good outlets, though never as good as the real thing!",
    "capricorn": "Jun 4, 2025- A visitor with a few problems might come to your door in search of advice and sympathy, Capricorn. He or she might also have some other news that could shock you. A professional crisis might make it necessary for you or your partner to spend most of the day away from home and family. This could be frustrating, particularly if you have to cancel plans. Hang in there!",
    "aquarius": "Jun 4, 2025- Tasks of any kind are likely to seem like the labors of Hercules today, Aquarius. Overwork and strain could have you feeling a little under the weather. It might be a good idea to take some time alone to rest. If you can't, at least try to take things easy. Also, some unexpected changes in your community might have tongues wagging. Be sure to check out the facts before jumping to conclusions.",
    "pisces": "Jun 4, 2025- Money matters might be weighing on the mind of a close friend or lover, Pisces, and he or she might seek your advice. A creative project may require a larger expenditure of money, time, or other resources than you originally thought. This could make you wonder if you will be able to continue with it. It might take some tweaking on your part, but you should be able to complete it as planned."
