    "aries": "Jan 27, 2026- Today is one of those days in which you just want to lie on your back on the ground and look up at the clouds, Aries. Your artistic mind can easily spot one that looks like a dragon, one that is a chair, and one that looks just like your mother. Pull someone down onto the grass with you and show that person what you see. There is a reason why your brain draws attention to certain shapes and not others. Find important clues in this information.",
    "taurus": "Jan 27, 2026- You're most likely going to be very drawn to the things that you can't have, Taurus. Instead of getting upset and frustrated by the fact that you aren't getting what you want, look for the lesson in the situation and the reason why you really don't need those things at all. Things with extremely high sentimental value may seem very important to you right now, but maybe there is an important reason why you need to let go and move on from that particular sentiment.",
    "gemini": "Jan 27, 2026- You may find yourself staring at a blank page for what seems like hours on end while you try to get down on paper what you really want to say, Gemini. Perhaps your motivation is flagging. Your mind is soaring in the clouds today and it may be hard for it to keep on task. However, once you start the act of writing or whatever job you need to finish, things seem to flow to completion on their own.",
    "cancer": "Jan 27, 2026- If you find yourself needing to do something in order to escape your life for a while, Cancer, then maybe you need to examine your life more closely. Instead of trying to figure out the best means of escape, try to figure out the best means for making your life more enjoyable. Make sure you're happy with yourself and the things that you're doing. If you aren't, it's time for a change.",
    "leo": "Jan 27, 2026- Keep your fun-loving spirit pure, Leo. Be careful that you aren't making witty conversation or entertaining jokes at someone else's expense. This type of behavior is likely to come back around and haunt you later. Keep things positive at all times, especially when you're tempted to spread information about someone that isn't exactly flattering. Today is one of those days in which you could easily slip and get your foot stuck in your mouth.",
    "virgo": "Jan 27, 2026- Your emotions are likely to deceive you today, so be careful about making a judgment about something, Virgo. Make sure that you take your time and gather all the necessary facts or else you may end up making an impulsive decision that you regret later on. The situations and people you encounter today are apt to be stubborn, emotional, or unreliable. If this is so, simply back away and address these things at some other time.",
    "libra": "Jan 27, 2026- Make your time spent with others much richer by contrasting it with time spent absolutely alone, Libra. You'll find that the more energy you can focus on yourself and your own thoughts for a while, the more you will have stored up in your emotional battery to share with others when you're with them. Be more selfish with your energy in terms of making sure that your inner sanctuary is being tended to regularly.",
    "scorpio": "Jan 27, 2026- Attend a lecture or some sort of intellectual discussion in which people are actively expressing their ideas and strong opinions, Scorpio. It's important for you to feel the passion of another who is incredibly focused on his or her dream. Get inspired today by those who speak with passion even though you might not necessarily agree with what they're saying. If you don't, feel free to respond with an equally passionate retort.",
    "sagittarius": "Jan 27, 2026- Your imagination is in all likelihood drawing you to faraway places, Sagittarius, and you may find yourself daydreaming constantly. At times, these dreams may seem to get in the way of your usual rational, linear way of dealing with everyday life. Remember that these dreams have been sent to you for a reason and that you should try to comprehend and consciously integrate their messages into your everyday waking life.",
    "capricorn": "Jan 27, 2026- Remember that there is a spirit in everything around you, Capricorn. Just because we can't perceive something with our eyes, ears, nose, mouth, or fingers doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Pay respect to the force field that surrounds us, and to the animate and inanimate forms that exist in our everyday life. You are apt to perceive life as if it were a prayer today.",
    "aquarius": "Jan 27, 2026- Share more of your passion, love, and happiness with the people around you, Aquarius. Put your energy toward a group project and work to co-create something much more magical and meaningful than anything you could create on your own. You aren't alone in this world, and you will find that you have a great deal to learn from working in close relationship with other people who share similar ideals.",
    "pisces": "Jan 27, 2026- Drastic shifts in your emotions might be causing you to doubt certain instincts or feelings you have, Pisces. Instead of getting frustrated by your inability to make rational sense of these emotions, enjoy the ride that they're offering you. Having these emotions and being able to express them freely is a great gift. Don't try to hide or suppress anything you feel. If it seems like you're on a roller coaster today, don't try to jump off halfway through the ride. You'll be much safer if you stay seated until the end."
